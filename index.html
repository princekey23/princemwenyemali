                        Being born and raised in the Democratic Republic of Congo isn't easy at all. We try to survive in any mean but our Country still pushing us back through hardship. Corruption has devastated the economy of our country at the level where 80% of the youth
                        remain unemployed. The country is rich in mineral resources but the population is poor. As a citizen I tried to hustle around the Country with no success so I moved from my hometown of Bukavu to Uvira, from Uvira it was still the
                        same so I moved to Lubumbashi until I decided to head to South Africa.

                        Uganda is wonderful place to live, But as it said that in every african nation, the major problem is access to employment. I guess that's true because even the Country that us in Congo consider richer than us are facing some common challenges as those
                        in Congo. Beside that I learnt to better use English vocabulary in Uganda so that's what helped me to survive in Kenya when I left Uganda.

                        the riches love the Country. So Kenya is far better than all East African countries including DRC. Kenyan motivated me and gave courage to work hard because they showed me that PHD doesn't get you a job in Africa but your thinking
                        capacity is what help you but you need to work hard. So kenyan are the most creative people from all the African countries that I've travelled to. Thank you Kenya for giving me confidence and focus on what I want to do.
